need to figure out the file structure

in the source file, it should contain the implementation of certain data structure. accompany the implementation file is the header that contains the class.

in the include file, public header, it is use to import the data structure to the main. i want to make the main split into multiple files such it separate the demonstration of other data structure.

also the public header should include an instance of that data structure with accessors. public header also needs an implementation file.
